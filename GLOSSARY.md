## Silence-as-Control
A control primitive where the system prefers no output over incoherent or drifting output.

## Proof-of-Resonance (PoR)
A longitudinal coherence metric measuring phase stability, drift, and entropy over time.

## Drift
Uncontrolled deviation of internal reasoning trajectory under perturbations.

## Coherence
Preservation of internal alignment across steps, not correctness of output.

## Phase Locking
~?%

## Phase-Lock Stability (PLS)
~?%
