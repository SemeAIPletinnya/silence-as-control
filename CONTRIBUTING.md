# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Silence-as-Control**.

This project is a research-oriented control-layer primitive for AI systems.
Contributions are welcome, but must align with the core principle:

> If continuity and coherence cannot be guaranteed, silence is preferred.

---

## What We Accept

We welcome contributions that improve:

- Conceptual clarity of Silence-as-Control
- Formalization of coherence, drift, or consensus metrics
- Well-documented experiments or evaluations
- Clear examples demonstrating control decisions
- Documentation, papers, or references related to AI safety and control layers

---

## What We Do NOT Accept

Please avoid contributions that:

- Turn this project into a chatbot or prompt collection
- Optimize for engagement instead of correctness
- Add speculative features without clear justification
- Dilute the control-layer focus

Silence-as-Control is not about producing more output.
It is about knowing **when not to produce output**.

## Contribution Process

1. Open an Issue describing the idea or problem
2. Clearly explain motivation and expected impact
3. Submit a Pull Request with:
   - Minimal changes
   - Clear reasoning
   - Documentation where applicable

Pull requests may be intentionally rejected without discussion
if they violate the core control principles.

This is a design choice, not an oversight.

## Philosophy First

This repository prioritizes:

- Correctness over completeness
- Integrity over responsiveness
- Control over generation

If in doubt — do less.

That is the point.
