# Security Policy

## Purpose

Silence-as-Control is a research-oriented control-layer primitive.
Security issues are treated as integrity and safety concerns, not as bugs.

If a vulnerability can cause misleading output instead of silence,
it is considered critical.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do NOT open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately by emailing:

**adelayida0403@gmail.net**

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Reproduction steps if applicable
- Why it impacts coherence, control, or system integrity

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- Control logic
- Coherence / drift mechanisms
- Multi-model arbitration logic
- Any component that may suppress or allow output

---

## Disclosure

Responsible disclosure is expected.

Public discussion may occur only **after** mitigation or explicit approval.

---

## Philosophy

Security failures are not always exploits.
Sometimes they are **failures to remain silent**.

That is the boundary this project protects.
