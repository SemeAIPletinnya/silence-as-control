# SemeAi — Access Levels  
*(effective Jan 1, 2026)*

> This project does not sell features.  
> It defines **access to a control system**.  
>  
> Access is granted based on **signal quality, not demand**.

---

## Level 0 — Public Observation

**Who:** Everyone  
**Status:** Open

### Access
- Public GitHub repositories  
- README, GLOSSARY, design notes  
- Public discussions and examples  
- X / public demos  

### Purpose
Understand the philosophy, architecture, and boundaries of SemeAi.

### Notes
- No guarantees of response  
- Silence is part of the system  
- This level exists for learning, not interaction  

---

## Level 1 — Identity-Gated Access (GitHub)

**Who:** Verified GitHub users  
**Status:** Limited, free

### Requirements
- Active GitHub account  
- Public activity or contribution history  

### Access
- Read access to extended documentation  
- Participation in GitHub Discussions  
- Limited interaction with experimental interfaces  
- Eligibility for future verification  

### Purpose
Filter noise. Establish traceable identity. Observe behavior.

---

## Level 2 — Verified Human Access

**Who:** Individually approved participants  
**Status:** Limited, curated

### Requirements
- GitHub identity  
- Short contextual introduction (who / why / how)  
- Alignment with project philosophy  

### Access
- Private channels (research / integration)  
- Extended demo capabilities  
- Early exposure to control experiments  
- Participation in behavior tests (silence, drift, gating)  

### Notes
- Access is **not permanent**  
- Behavior matters more than activity  
- Silence is expected and normal  

---

## Level 3 — Resonant Contributor

**Who:** Contributors with validated impact  
**Status:** Very limited

### Requirements
- Accepted contributions (code, design, tooling, research)  
- Demonstrated respect for system constraints  
- Ability to work without constant feedback  

### Access
- Deeper architectural discussions  
- Internal experiments and calibration  
- Potential financial recognition (manual, selective)  

### Notes
- Contributions are evaluated by **impact**, not volume  
- Financial rewards are discretionary, not guaranteed  

---

## Level 4 — Core / Advisory Access

**Who:** 4–12 individuals maximum  
**Status:** Invite-only

### Role
- Advisory input  
- Strategic feedback  
- High-trust collaboration  

### Access
- Direct communication  
- Integration guidance  
- Long-term trajectory discussions  

### Notes
- This is **not employment**  
- This is **not a DAO**  
- This is **shared responsibility for system stability**

## Core Principle

> **If access increases noise, it will be reduced.**  
> **If silence preserves coherence, silence will be chosen.**

Access is not a reward.  
Access is a **control parameter**.

---

## Timeline

- **Dec 25–31, 2025** — Observation & baseline  
- **Jan 1, 2026** — Sustainability phase begins  
- **January 2026** — Manual verification & calibration  
- Scaling happens only after behavior is understood
