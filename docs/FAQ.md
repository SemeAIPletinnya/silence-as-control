🔹 Q: What does “Coherence” mean in PoR?

A:
Coherence is not a measure of “quality” or “beauty” of an answer.

In PoR, coherence is a gate condition.
	•	If coherence ≥ threshold → the system is allowed to respond
	•	If coherence < threshold → silence is the correct action

Coherence defines whether the system has the right to act.

Mapping:
coherence → gate

🔹 Q: What is Drift?

A:
Drift is not an error.

Drift is the accumulated deviation of system state from its historical trajectory.
	•	It indicates loss of alignment with prior context
	•	It is measured longitudinally, not per response
	•	It triggers correction or silence

Drift describes how the system is moving, not whether it is wrong.

Mapping:
drift → state derivative

⸻

🔹 Q: What is Noise?

A:
Noise is not junk and not something to eliminate.

Noise is:
	•	the environment
	•	the stressor
	•	the background against which stability is tested

Without noise, resonance cannot be detected.

Noise reveals robustness.

Mapping:
noise → stressor

⸻

🔹 Q: Why does the system sometimes remain silent?

A:
Silence is a control decision, not a failure.

The system remains silent when:
	•	coherence is below threshold
	•	drift exceeds safe bounds
	•	internal signals conflict
	•	the system is uncertain about utility

Silence prevents hallucination and long-term degradation.

🔹 Q: Is Silence-as-Control a refusal mechanism?

A:
No.

Refusal is content-based.
Silence-as-Control is state-based.

It is triggered by internal coherence signals, not policy constraints.
